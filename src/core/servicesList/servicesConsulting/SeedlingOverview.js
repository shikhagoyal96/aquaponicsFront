Following the correct steps in germination, growers can harvest fresh produce in a matter of months. Below are the five best seeds to plant in aquaponics:</b></p>

                <h1><b>SEED STARTING METHODS</b></h1>
                <p><b>There are three ways that the growers can choose from if they opt to plant seeds instead of cutting or cloning: direct sowing, broadcasting, and using starter plugs. Another alternative option is purchasing plant starts to avoid going through the process of germination.</b></p>
                <h2><b>Direct Sowing</b></h2>
                <p>This method of growing seeds is often used in media bed systems where grow media supports plant structure. The seeds are distributed evenly on the grow beds and pushed down under the grower s chosen media. One of the main advantages of this method is that the plants are no longer needed to be transplanted.</p>
                <h2><b>Broadcasting</b></h2>
                <p>Just like direct sowing, this technique also skips the transplanting phase because the seeds are directly planted in the grow beds by scattering them on the growing media. However, broadcasting is not usually successful because some seeds fail to germinate since they do not reach the correct depth level to grow.</p>
                <h2><b>Starter Plugs</b></h2>
                <p>Using starter plugs is an excellent method of arranging seedlings in an organized manner in the grow beds. Once the seeds have already germinated in the plugs, they can be transferred into the beds by creating small holes in the media. Some of the most common starter plugs are compressed peat and rock wool which can be sourced online from Amazon.</p>
                <h2><b>Purchasing plant starts</b></h2>
                <p>For gardeners who find seed starting difficult, another alternative option is buying plant starts. The grower only has to clean the roots of the plant to make sure there is no dirt or any bugs before transplanting it to the system.</p>
                <h1><b>BEST SEEDS FOR AQUAPONICS</b></h1>
                <p><b>When it comes to the plants that can be grown in an aquaponics system, the varieties are extensive, and the gardeners can practically choose any type as long as they do thorough research on the ideal growing conditions for their choices. As for the best seeds for aquaponics systems that a lot of farmers choose, lettuce, basil, pepper, and tomatoes are among the top picks. Below is a detailed discussion of the seeds mentioned above:</b></p>
                <h4><b>Lettuce</b></h4>
                <img className="SeedsImage" src="images/img-42.jpg" />
                <p>Lettuce is perhaps one of the most favorite plants of aquaponics practitioners because it is quite easy to grow, and it thrives in cold seasons. It is best planted using a specially-made floating raft system or through styrofoam sheets. The seeds should be germinated beforehand through rock wool or oasis cubes before transplanting. 

                Lettuce seedlings usually take one to two weeks to germinate before it can be transplanted. It should have two to three leaves and should be given supplement fertilizer to avoid transplant stress.
