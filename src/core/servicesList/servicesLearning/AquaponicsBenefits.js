                <p><b>Aquaponics systems are a great solution for healthy organic food production. Aquaponics provides a great number of benefits compared to traditional farming and hydroponics. The most important ones are as follows:</b></p>
                <ul className="Checklist">

                    <li><b>Up to 10 Times More Plants!</b> With aquaponics you place plants closer together on a float system above the water, therefore it fits 10 times more plants in the same space! The roots of the plants are always in nutrient rich water and there's no over-crowding! </li>
<li><b> No More Watering!</b> The aquaponics system uses only 2% of the water normal gardening does... Because the water is constantly re-circulated , and you do not lose any to soil absorption. The roots of your plants are constantly submerged in nutrient rich water and you never have to worry about watering plants again.

                    If you pay for your water... imagine of how much money this can possible save you.</li>



                  <li><b>  Multiple Sources of Income</b> When you try the aquaponics system yourself, you'll have more plants than you'll know what to do with. If you decide to sell your vegetables ...guess what... you also have fish to sell! The aquaponics system produces both plants and fish</li>



                    <li><b>   Grows Plants Twice as Fast</b> Because your plants are getting rich alive nutrients such as algae from the fish, right at the root level , 24 hours a day, 7 days a week... plants thrive like never before. You won't believe your eyes at how fast plants grow, and how great the fruit tastes! </li>
                    <li><b>   Amazing Organic Plants!</b> USDA Organic Certifiable Aquaponically grown produce tastes incredible , and it's organic! Some commercial aquaponic farms have already gotten USDA Organic certifiable.</li>



                    <li><b>  Uses 60%-70% Less Energy </b>You save money and time with this system. The only energy involved in an aquaponic farm is electric energy to circulate water. Almost all your gardening expenses are minimized or diminished.</li>



                    <li><b>  No More Weeding or Soil Work!</b> Imagine no more weeding or fussing with soil, no more fertilizer or compost work. All this hard work is removed and automated by the nutrient delivery system. This is worth gold by itself!</li>



                    <li><b>  No More Back-Straining Planting!</b> Planting normally takes a lot of bending, not with Aquaponics . You'll find out exactly how to plant your seedlings in the aquaponic floats, and how to make sure the roots get all the nutrients.  </li>
                </ul>
